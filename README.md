# img_classification_futurama
Using neural nets to classify futurama images

The following trains a neural network to predict whether a given image (frame of a futurama episode) contains one of the three characters Bender, Fry, and Leela. The output is a 3 dimensional probability vector (one probability for each character) which is then transformed to three booleans (contained - not contained for each character).


The repo is inspired by work done by Ewald Gro√üe-Wilde
